The process to calculate the histogram:
- Compute the histogram of image to get the threshold value
- Apply with threshold value, canny algorithm with threshold value
- Get the edges after using canny
- Break the edges into approximate lines.
- Calculate the pairwise geometric histogram of pair lines.
The shape geometric histogram is consist all PGH of all approximate lines.
We develop 2 version for PGH:
Version 1:(before 11 - 09 - 2015)
 -- Angle axis: 180 bins (a bin for each degree)
 -- Perpendicular distance: use width of reference for all images, if image have
	the perpendicular distance greater than width, adding to the largest entries in 
	histogram.
Version 2: (11 - 09 - 2015)
 -- Angle axis: accuracy to minutes 
 -- Perpendicular distance: keep same with version 1
